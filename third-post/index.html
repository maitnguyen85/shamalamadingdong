She arrived with her Uncle last Thursday fortnight, when, of course, I lost no time in demanding the reason of her behaviour; &amp; soon found myself to have been perfectly right in attributing it to my own letter. The purport of it frightened her so thoroughly that, with a mixture of true girlish perverseness &amp; folly, without considering that she could not escape from my authority by running away from Wigmore Street, she resolved on getting out of the house &amp; proceeding directly by the stage to her friends, the Clarkes; &amp; had really got as far as the length of two streets in her journey when she was fortunately miss'd, pursued, &amp; overtaken.<br><br>Such was the first distinguished exploit of Miss Frederica Susanna Vernon; &amp; if we consider that it was achieved at the tender age of sixteen, we shall have room for the most flattering prognostics of her future renown. I am excessively provoked, however, at the parade of propriety which prevented Miss Summers from keeping the girl; &amp; it seems so extraordinary a piece of nicety, considering my daughter's family connections, that I can only suppose the Lady to be governed by the fear of never getting her money. Be that as it may, however, Frederica is returned on my hands; and having now nothing else to employ her, is busy in pursuing the plan of Romance begun at Langford. She is actually falling in love with Reginald De Courcy! To disobey her Mother by refusing an unexceptionable offer is not enough; her affections must likewise be given without her Mother's approbation. I never saw a girl of her age bid fairer to be the sport of Mankind. Her feelings are tolerably acute, &amp; she is so charmingly artless in their display as to afford the most reasonable hope of her being ridiculed &amp; despised by every Man who sees her.<br><br>Artlessness will never do in Love matters; &amp; that girl is born a simpleton who has it either by nature or affectation. I am not yet certain that Reginald sees what she is about; nor is it of much consequence. She is now an object of indifference to him; she would be one of contempt were he to understand her Emotions. Her beauty is much admired by the Vernons, but it has no effect on him. She is in high favour with her Aunt altogether -- because she is so little like myself, of course. She is exactly the companion for Mrs. Vernon, who dearly loves to be first, &amp; to have all the sense &amp; all the wit of the Conversation to herself: Frederica will never eclipse her. When she first came, I was at some pains to prevent her seeing much of her Aunt; but I have since relaxed, as I beleive I may depend on her observing the rules I have laid down for their discourse.<br><br>But do not imagine that with all this Lenity I have for a moment given up my plan of her marriage; No, I am unalterably fixed on this point, tho' I have not yet quite decided on the manner of bringing it about. I should not chuse to have the business brought forward here, &amp; canvassed by the wise heads of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Vernon; &amp; I cannot just now afford to go to Town. Miss Frederica therefore must wait a little.</p></div><aside><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 25, 2020</p><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer><div class="post__bio"><h3><a href="https://maitnguyen85.github.io/shamalamadingdong/authors/polaroid-android/" class="inverse" title="Polaroid Android">Polaroid Android</a></h3></div><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://maitnguyen85.github.io/shamalamadingdong/love/books/">books</a></li><li><a href="https://maitnguyen85.github.io/shamalamadingdong/love/writings/">writings</a></li></ul><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h5"><a href="https://maitnguyen85.github.io/shamalamadingdong/second-post/" class="inverse" rel="prev">Second Post</a></h3></div></nav><div class="post__related"><h3>Related posts</h3><div class="post__related__wrap"><figure><a href="https://maitnguyen85.github.io/shamalamadingdong/second-post/"><img src="https://maitnguyen85.github.io/shamalamadingdong/media/posts/2/responsive/unsplash-Will-Turner-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></a><figcaption><time datetime="2020-07-25T17:00">July 25, 2020</time><h4><a href="https://maitnguyen85.github.io/shamalamadingdong/second-post/" class="inverse">Second Post</a></h4></figcaption></figure><figure><a href="https://maitnguyen85.github.io/shamalamadingdong/first-post/"><img src="https://maitnguyen85.github.io/shamalamadingdong/media/posts/1/responsive/mitchell-luo-XvSb5B9SZ9o-unsplash-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></a><figcaption><time datetime="2020-07-25T16:58">July 25, 2020</time><h4><a href="https://maitnguyen85.github.io/shamalamadingdong/first-post/" class="inverse">First Post</a></h4></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article></main></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii Static CMS</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://maitnguyen85.github.io/shamalamadingdong/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
